[{"title": "Downstream video composition", "code": "10,368,108", "year": 2013, "inventors": "Glen; David I. J. (Toronto, CA)", "num_inventors": 1, "abstract": "A video source, a display and a method of processing multilayered video are disclosed. The video source decodes a multilayered video bit stream to transmit synchronized streams of decompressed video images and corresponding overlay images to an interconnected display. The display receives separate streams of video and overlay images. Transmission and reception of corresponding video and overlay images is synchronized in time. A video image received in the display can be selectively processed separately from its corresponding overlay image. The video image as processed at the display is later composited with its corresponding overlay image to form an output image for display."}, {"title": "Displaying DCI and other content on an enhanced dynamic range projector", "code": "10,368,044", "year": 2016, "inventors": "Richards; Martin J.

One embodiment of an EDR projector system comprises a first modulator and a second modulator. One method for rendering DCI-compliant image data on an EDR projector system comprises: receiving input image data, said image data comprising a plurality of image formats; determining whether the input image data comprises DCI image data; if the input image data comprises DCI image data, then performing dynamic range (DR) processing on the DCI image data; and rendering the dynamic range processed DCI image data on the EDR projector system. One DR processing method is to set the first modulator to a desired luminance level--e.g., fully ON or a ratio of DCI max luminance to the EDR max luminance. In addition, a desired minimum level of luminance may be set for the EDR projector."}, {"title": "Displaying DCI and other content on an enhanced dynamic range projector", "code": "10,368,044", "year": 2016, "inventors": "Richards; Martin J.
